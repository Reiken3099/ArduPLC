# ArduPLC

PCB board designs developed with the purpose of being used as an alternative to the widely known PLCs in industrial environments, focusing on keeping these PCB boards as closely attached to what is currently used in the industry in terms of voltages and currents. This project does not seek in any way to replace the use of PLC devices in the industry or any related element, it is developed with the sole purpose of having a reliable and low-cost alternative to such devices, mainly for small or micro companies that require a considerable degree of automation keeping your costs and expenses as low as possible.

These boards base their operation on the ATMEL microcontrollers used in the Arduino boards, for which these can be programmed in a simple and intuitive way using the Arduino IDE software, loading the bootloader of the corresponding Arduino boards in these microcontrollers, or failing that as well They can be programmed using assembly language or C ++ and programmed with the help of a microcontroller recorder or charger. Any PCB board shown here was designed to be used with the Arduino bootloader, since by including this, you can use the program free software called "LDmicro", through which you can program ATMEL microcontrollers with the Arduino bootloader using the LADDER language or also known as the ladder language, the same language that is used to program PLC devices today.

This is a project that is currently under development, so the plates shown here have not yet been polished in terms of design and structure of their components, however, each one is fully functional and has been physically and different simulations.
